                <h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
                <br><h3><strong>Where do you get funding?</strong></h3>
                    <p>Our econonmy plan relies on our ability to reach out to you and show you that this is a solution to
                        get behind!<br>  We have some financial support from stakeholders around the world, these are people that 
                        believe in<br> making change, and helping the less fortunate people. We are in a dialog with 
                        'Save the Children'<br> and 'UNICEF'. Therefore, we are currently awaiting a conclusion regarding the
                        roadmap ahead!<br> We are very excited to bring about positive change!
                    </p>
                <br><h3><strong>How feasible is this?</strong></h3>
                    <p>This is a very feasible solution, it does not require a lot of infrastructure. <br> 
                        It only requires the possibility to transport the documents to a database<br>
                        where they can be registered to the database.
                    </p>
                <br><h3><strong>How can i contribute to your cause?</strong></h3>
                    <p>Easy! If you would like to help us bring about change, you should help us spread the word about our<br>
                        initiative, and help us grow, which will give us more weight and enabling us to make a bigger impact<br>
                        for the benefit of schools in Africa! The second thing would be to email the leader/politician<br> closest to you
                        and write about what we are doing and make them care,<br> and try to convince them why it would be a good thing to do!
