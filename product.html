            <br><h3>A big problem in education</h3>
            <p>
                The dropout rate of students in the world is a major issue, it is the most critical in Africa,<br>
                where education is the key to everything. A big part of the problem is the lack of ability to <br>
                follow up on the students dropping out, perhaps a sick parent, a dangerous commute to school in a turbulent region.<br> 
                According to research, from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation amongst others, shows us that monitoring students<br>
                attendance could help prevent the student dropping out of school. You could therefore decrease the dropout rate by<br>
                activating counter-measures, such as adapting the students schedule in a way that allows the student to stay in school, <br>
                perhaps basing it more on homework or other measures. Data on attendance is shown to be critical information prior to<br>
                a student dropping out.  
            </p>
            <h3>How does the Data Harvest help solve this?</h3>
            <p>
                The Data Harvest is a machine readable attendance document, which will be distributed to African schools,<br> 
                where the teacher will fill in attendance of students, it will then be transported to a local database,<br>
                where the document is read and registered to a database, storing all attendance data. Once you have attendance<br>
                data, the data can tell you something about which students are in danger of dropping out. From there the teacher<br>
                will put measures into place, depending on the individual student and the issues he or she faces.
